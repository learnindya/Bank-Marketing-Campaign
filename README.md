## Exploratory Data Analysis
- The average age of customer is 39. Customers are mostly in the 18-70 age bracket.
- The average balance is 448 euros.
- Bank made calls evenly throughout the month. May recorded the highest count of calls. March has the highest conversion rate, followed by December, September, October.
- Bank typically made 2 calls, with average duration per call is 180 s (3 minutes). 
- Most customer hasn't been contacted previously.
- Most customers are blue-collar workers, followed by management, technician, admin, and services in order. The highest conversion rate happened to student, followed by retired, unemployed, management and admin.
- 60% of customers are married, followed by single and divorced. Relatively, single customers responded better than divorced and married customers.
- More than a half customers completed secondary education, with 30% in tertiary level. Higher education seems to imply higher conversion rate.
- 98% of customers do not have default credit account and 84% of customers do not have personal loan.
- Customers who have housing loan are 10% higher than those without housing loan.
- Most customers do not have a history of previous campaign. It seems that the bank has no resource and didn't properly follow up its previous campaign and record the result, because almost 82% records are identified as 'unknown'.
- Overall, there are only 12% of customers who opened a term deposit. Customers who opened deposit account mostly do not have any loan and unpaid credit.
